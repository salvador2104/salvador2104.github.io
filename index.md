### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    In lab 5, part 3, my partner and I created a program to count up cards and determine whether the player won. It was one of the first programs we had to develop on our own. Leading up to this lab, we were given detailed instructions on exactly what we should write. Part 3 took our training wheels away and allowed us to solve the problem independently. The lab was tricky, but I enjoyed creating it, and seeing it work was very rewarding.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2, added to the blackjack program we created in lab 5. We implemented functions to create an easier-to-understand, simpler, and more efficient Blackjack program. I enjoyed this lab because I learned how to use functions to solve a recurring problem which was very exciting. This program also introduced me to the essential coding principle DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself).

* Lab 8

    In lab-8, part 3, we used file input and output to create a program that reads ANSI & ASCII animations from files. This program was one of the most straightforward yet enjoyable programs we created. It introduced me to the animation side of programming and made me realize just how complicated animations were.
